this project was created using html, css and javascript.For this second profile i add some small project to it for more about my skills and what i can do. 
I used Sass style for the first time and found that its best suited for programmers to understand their css style of coding insereted of targetting element one by one sass you can nest those elements within each other for a more clean and readable css file.
